# 3D-City-Graphics-Project-Demo-
Fully 3D city written in JavaScript

This repository holds my portion of a 3D city coded almost entirely in JavaScript created as a demonstration of all the computer graphics skills I learned and practiced over the course of my Introduction to Computer Graphics course. More specifically, this city creates the city of Midgar, the main city in Square Enix's Final Fantasy VII for Playstation 1. It encorperates a large, combined metal structure that is seamlessly fit together with created 3D object. It features a number of 3D graphics concepts like 3D triangular meshes, StepWorld animation loops, articulated motion, texture overlay and a vector and fragment shader to create the metal look. Below are some pictures showing what the city looks like in a 3D canvas.
